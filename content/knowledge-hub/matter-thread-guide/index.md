Smart homes are evolving — and two new protocols are leading the charge: **Matter** and **Thread**.

Together, they aim to fix what’s broken with current smart home ecosystems: fragmentation, cloud dependence, and lack of interoperability.

## What is Matter?

**Matter** is a unified open-source standard developed by the **Connectivity Standards Alliance** (formerly Zigbee Alliance). It was launched with backing from tech giants like Apple, Google, Amazon, and Samsung.

### Key Goals of Matter:

- 🔒 **Local and Secure** communication.
- 🌉 **Cross-Platform Interoperability** (Apple, Google, Alexa, SmartThings, Home Assistant).
- 🧩 **Simple Setup** with QR-code pairing.
- 🌎 **Open Ecosystem** that encourages brand collaboration.

Matter supports common device types like:

- Lights
- Switches
- Sensors
- Locks
- Thermostats
- TVs and more

## What is Thread?

**Thread** is a low-power wireless mesh protocol that complements Matter.

Think of Thread as the **network** and Matter as the **language** devices speak.

### Why Thread is Important:

- 📡 Mesh networking (each device extends coverage).
- 🔋 Low power usage (ideal for sensors).
- 🌐 IPv6-based (future-proof).
- 🛡️ Self-healing network with no single point of failure.

Thread-enabled devices typically need a **Thread Border Router**, like:

- **Apple HomePod Mini**
- **Google Nest Hub (2nd Gen)**
- **Amazon Echo (latest)**
- **Home Assistant Yellow / Home Assistant SkyConnect**

## Matter + Thread in Action

Once set up, Matter devices using Thread can:

- Work locally without relying on the cloud.
- Respond faster and more reliably.
- Be controlled from multiple ecosystems at once.

## Compatible Brands (as of 2025)

- **Apple** – HomePod Mini, Apple TV 4K.
- **Google Nest** – Hubs and routers.
- **Amazon** – Echo, eero routers.
- **Nanoleaf** – Shapes, Essentials bulbs and strips. [View](https://nanoleaf.me/en-AU/)
- **Eve** – Motion, energy, and door sensors. [View](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/collections/eve)
- **TP-Link/Kasa** – Upcoming Matter-enabled plugs and switches. [View](https://www.tp-link.com/au/smarthome/)
- **Aqara** – Matter bridges and sensors. [View](https://www.aqarastore.com.au/)

## Matter & Thread in Home Assistant

Home Assistant now natively supports Matter and Thread through:

- **Home Assistant Green or Yellow**.
- **SkyConnect USB stick**.
- **Matter add-on with multiprotocol support**.

This opens up your smart home to future-proof automation — all running **locally**, securely, and vendor-agnostic.
