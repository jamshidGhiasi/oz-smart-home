Smart blinds can dramatically improve comfort, energy efficiency, and aesthetics in your smart home.

## Why Automate Blinds?

By automating blinds, you can:

- Reduce heat during summer
- Wake up naturally with morning sunlight
- Enhance privacy automatically at night

## Required Devices

You'll need:

- Smart blinds or motors (Zigbee, Matter, or Wi-Fi)
- A compatible hub (e.g., Home Assistant)
- Light or temperature sensors (optional)


## Home Assistant Integration

Most Zigbee or Wi-Fi blind motors integrate easily with Home Assistant. Once set up, you can:

- Create schedules
- Use sunrise/sunset triggers
- Add voice control (via Siri, Alexa, or Google)

## Example Automations

Here are a few useful YAML automations to get started:

### 1. Close blinds after sunset

```yaml
alias: Close blinds after sunset
trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunset
action:
  - service: cover.close_cover
    target:
      entity_id: cover.living_room_blinds
mode: single
```

### 2. Open blinds at 7:00 AM
```yaml
alias: Open blinds in the morning
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "07:00:00"
action:
  - service: cover.open_cover
    target:
      entity_id: cover.bedroom_blinds
mode: single
```
### 3. Open blinds to 50% at sunrise
```yaml
alias: Open blinds halfway at sunrise
trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunrise
action:
  - service: cover.set_cover_position
    target:
      entity_id: cover.kitchen_blinds
    data:
      position: 50
mode: single
```
