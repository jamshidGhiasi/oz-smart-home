Zigbee is a low-power, wireless mesh communication protocol used extensively in smart home devices. It enables reliable, local device-to-device communication without relying heavily on Wi-Fi or the cloud.

## A Brief History

Zigbee was introduced in the early 2000s and is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. It was designed to provide simple, low-power wireless connectivity for short-range communication — ideal for sensors, lights, and switches.

Over the years, Zigbee has been adopted by hundreds of companies, leading to the creation of the **Zigbee Alliance** (now called the **Connectivity Standards Alliance**, or CSA), which also oversees **Matter**.

## Key Benefits of Zigbee

- 🔋 **Low Power Consumption**: Perfect for battery-powered sensors and devices.
- 🔁 **Mesh Networking**: Each device strengthens the network by repeating signals.
- 🌐 **Local Control**: Works even when your internet is down.
- 🔌 **Interoperability**: Many devices from different brands work together (when certified).

## How to Use Zigbee with Home Assistant

Zigbee integrates with Home Assistant using:

- **ZHA** (Zigbee Home Automation) — Built-in integration.
- **Zigbee2MQTT** — Popular for power users wanting greater control.

You'll need a **Zigbee coordinator** such as:

- 🟢 **Sonoff Zigbee Dongle Plus**
- 🔵 **ConBee II USB Stick**

Once configured, Zigbee devices are fast, responsive, and reliable — ideal for critical automations like lights, sensors, and locks.
